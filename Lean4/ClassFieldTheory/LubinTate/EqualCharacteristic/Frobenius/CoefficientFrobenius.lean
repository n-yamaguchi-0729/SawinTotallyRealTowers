# The equal-characteristic completed-unramified construction: equal-characteristic Frobenius on the completed unramified ring

For a finite field `k`, arithmetic Frobenius acts on `AlgebraicClosure k`
by the `#k`-power map and hence coefficientwise on
`(AlgebraicClosure k)[[T]]`.  These definitions belong to the completed
maximal-unramified source used in the equal-characteristic completed-unramified construction; the theta construction of the equal-characteristic theta construction
depends on them, not conversely.

This is an equal-characteristic specialization of the general local-field construction, not a claim that Lemma the equal-characteristic completed-unramified construction is complete in general.
