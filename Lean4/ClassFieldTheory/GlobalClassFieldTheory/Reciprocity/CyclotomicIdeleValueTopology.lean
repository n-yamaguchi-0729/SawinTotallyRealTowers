# Topology of the rational cyclotomic idele value

The rational cyclotomic idele value is constructed multiplicatively in
`CyclotomicIdeleValue`.  For descent to the additive idele class group and
for the valuation package, this file records its genuine continuous additive
form.  Its finite reductions give the open-kernel finite quotients which form
the profinite neighbourhood system used after principal-idèle vanishing has
been proved.
