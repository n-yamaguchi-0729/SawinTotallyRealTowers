# Continuous transport between equal quotient groups

Equality of normal subgroups identifies their quotient groups with the same
native quotient topology.  Eliminating the equality therefore gives the
continuous multiplicative equivalence directly; no discrete-topology
instances or domain-specific class-field tower are required.
