# Universe boundary for integral representations

Mathlib's `Rep ℤ G` currently requires the coefficient ring and acting group
to inhabit the same universe.  Since `ℤ : Type 0`, every representation-bearing
part of local class field theory uses this single named boundary.  Keeping the
restriction here makes a future universe-polymorphic migration searchable and
prevents individual subtrees from inventing private aliases.
